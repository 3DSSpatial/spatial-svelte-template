# Zea Svelte Template

## Features

- Built on top of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), a radical new approach to building user interfaces.
- Includes the latest stable versions of the Zea tools: [Zea Engine](https://docs.zea.live/zea-engine/), [Zea UI](https://web-components.zea.live/), [Zea UX](https://docs.zea.live/zea-ux/), and [Zea Collab](https://docs.zea.live/zea-collab/).
- Supports [SSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting).

## Prerequisites

To get this template working, you're going to need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (preferably the latest LTS version).

## Getting Started

Our recommended way to clone this template is by using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit), a project scaffolding tool.

1. Run this command on your terminal:

```bash
npx degit zeainc/zea-svelte-template#main my-awesome-app
```

2. The above command will create the `my-awesome-app` directory for you. Go into it:

```bash
cd my-awesome-app
```

3. Install the project's dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start a development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Use your browser to go to: http://localhost:5000/

6. Build something awesome.

# Features

## UI

The template app leverages the Zea UI library for all its User interface components.

> http://web-components.zea.live/

The UI library is built using the new 'web components' technology supported in all modern browsers.

## UX

The template leverages the Zea UX library to provide Undo, Redo and tools such as selection manager, transform tools.

> https://docs.zea.live/zea-ux

## User Identification and Authentication

This template app comes with a simple user identification and authentication system. Users enter their name and an optional password to gain access to the app.

```javascript
onMount(async () => {
  const isAuthenticated = await auth.isAuthenticated()
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    $redirect('/login')
  }
})
```

The Authentication can be disabled by commenting out the $redirect('/login') line in the index.svelte file.

> Note: the 'auth.js' file is designed to support integrating other authentication systems provided by frameworks such as Firebase or Auth0.

## Collaboration

If a user is identified, then the app integrates the powerful collaboration framework refrred to as 'Collab.

> https://docs.zea.live/zea-collab/

```javascript
const SOCKET_URL = 'https://websocket-staging.zea.live'
const ROOM_ID = 'zea-template-collab'
```

> Note: the roomID is what defines whether users of a given app are visible to each other. Always customize this value to avoid collisions with other apps.

```javascript
const session = new Session(userData, SOCKET_URL)
session.joinRoom(ROOM_ID)
const sessionSync = new SessionSync(session, appData, userData, {})
```

## CAD

the Zea CAD library comes pre-integrated and a sample zcad file is loaded.

> https://docs.zea.live/zea-cad/

```javascript
const asset = new CADAsset()
asset.getGeometryLibrary().on('loaded', () => {
  renderer.frameAll()
})
scene.getRoot().addChild(asset)
asset.getParameter('FilePath').setValue('/assets/HC_SRO4.zcad')
```

The code above loads the sample cad file.
